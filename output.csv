ici Barbès,pro,517,2,0,103,110,0,102,550822,"To mark World Water Day, on March 22nd Solidarités International and its agency BDDP Unlimited will roll out a campaign to build awareness of the scourge of undrinkable water. 

Today, it is estimated that 3.6 million people, including 1.5 million children under the age of 5, die every year of diseases borne by unhealthy water, making it the world’s leading cause of death.

Yet the public isn’t aware of it and political leaders do not demonstrate the drive it takes to end the terrible deaths. The campaign calls on journalists to spread awareness of this scourge and appeal to readers to sign a petition that will be personally handed to the French president during the 6th World Water Forum in March 2012.

To evoke the silent and invisible threat of unhealthy water, BDDP Unlimited opted for a minimalist approach that is both visually appealing and surprising, using water and ink exclusively. The spot shows the power of ink to reveal the invisible.

The spot, created by BDDP Unlimited, produced by Hush and directed by Clément Beauvais, a young director, illustrator, musician and photographer. His multiple talents and mastery of various techniques enabled him to both create the drawings and direct the spot.

The campaign will be seen from mid-March on TV, in cinemas, on the Internet and in print. A dedicated web site, www.votregouttedeau.org, will gather signatures for the petition.",0.9999977

But as soon as you view it against the vast distances of the universe, it's unfortunately very slow. This animation illustrates, in realtime, the journey of a photon of light emitted from the surface of the sun and traveling across a portion of the solar system, from a human perspective.

I've taken liberties with certain things like the alignment of planets and asteroids, as well as ignoring the laws of relativity concerning what a photon actually "sees" or how time is experienced at the speed of light, but overall I've kept the size and distances of all the objects as accurate as possible. I also decided to end the animation just past Jupiter as I wanted to keep the running length below an hour.

A Short Animation Inspired by the Works of İlhan Koman 

Plato Art Space is proud to present Candaş Şişman’s video dedicated to famous sculptor İlhan Koman produced for the exhibition İlhan Koman: Hulda Festival, a Journey into Art and Science opening on the 22nd September, 2010.
İlhan Koman’s unique design approach in his form studies also inspires contemporary art works. The video installation Flux by young artist Candaş Şişman can be defined as a digital animation which is inspired from the structural features of some of İlhan Koman’s works like Pi, 3D Moebius, Whirlpool and To Infinity... A red circle, which is colored in reference to the red radiators of Ogre, is traced in a morphological transformation which re-interprets the formal approach of Koman’s works. The continuous movement sometimes connotes the formal characteristics of Pi, 3D Moebius, Whirlpool and To Infinity..., as well as the original formal interpretations of the design principles of the works . In Flux, Koman’s design process in the making of the Pi series has been treated as the emerging of a sphere from a two-dimensional circle by the principle of increasing the surface; and that simple direction is re-interpreted in digital medium. Thanks to this, in the digital animation an entirely different form serial that does not resemble Pi yet remaining its design principle can be followed through the flow of a circle to the sphere. As a conscious attitude of the artist, this work is not designed in a direct visual analogy with Koman’s works. During the animation, none of the moments of the transforming form look like Pi or 3D Moebius, however the subjective reading of Koman’s approach can be observed. 

With the integration of the sounds of various materials – which Koman used in his sculptures – Flux turns into an impressive spatial experience. Flux, also exemplifies that Koman’s work can be re-interpreted by the analysis and manipulation of form in the digital medium.",1.0

Cheetahs are the fastest runners on the planet. Combining the resources of National Geographic Magazine and the Cincinnati Zoo, and drawing on the skills of an incredible crew, we documented these amazing cats in a way that’s never been done before.

Using a Phantom camera filming at 1200 frames per second while zooming beside a sprinting cheetah, the team captured every nuance of the cat’s movement as it reached top speeds of 60+ miles per hour.

The extraordinary footage that follows is a compilation of multiple runs by five cheetahs during three days of filming.

We travel from the Verdon gorge to the skyscrapers of Paris, and finally to the spectacular cliffs and fjords of Norway - where the pair plan to put weeks spent training to the ultimate test. Could months of planning and training really lead them to their dream of complete freedom... the freedom of flight?

Chernobyl is one of the most interesting and dangerous places I've been. The nuclear disaster, which happened in 1986 (the year after I was born), had an effect on so many people, including my family when we lived in Italy.  The nuclear dust clouds swept westward towards us.  The Italian police went round and threw away all the local produce and my mother rushed out to purchase as much tinned milk as possible to feed me, her infant son.
 
It caused so much distress hundreds of miles away, so I can't imagine how terrifying it would have been for the hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian citizens who were forced to evacuate.
 
During my stay, I met so many amazing people, one of whom was my guide Yevgen, also known as a 'Stalker'. We spent the week together exploring Chernobyl and the nearby abandoned city of Pripyat. There was something serene, yet highly disturbing about this place. Time has stood still and there are memories of past happenings floating around us.

A Short Animation Inspired by the Works of İlhan Koman 

Plato Art Space is proud to present Candaş Şişman’s video dedicated to famous sculptor İlhan Koman produced for the exhibition İlhan Koman: Hulda Festival, a Journey into Art and Science opening on the 22nd September, 2010.
İlhan Koman’s unique design approach in his form studies also inspires contemporary art works. The video installation Flux by young artist Candaş Şişman can be defined as a digital animation which is inspired from the structural features of some of İlhan Koman’s works like Pi, 3D Moebius, Whirlpool and To Infinity... A red circle, which is colored in reference to the red radiators of Ogre, is traced in a morphological transformation which re-interprets the formal approach of Koman’s works. The continuous movement sometimes connotes the formal characteristics of Pi, 3D Moebius, Whirlpool and To Infinity..., as well as the original formal interpretations of the design principles of the works . In Flux, Koman’s design process in the making of the Pi series has been treated as the emerging of a sphere from a two-dimensional circle by the principle of increasing the surface; and that simple direction is re-interpreted in digital medium. Thanks to this, in the digital animation an entirely different form serial that does not resemble Pi yet remaining its design principle can be followed through the flow of a circle to the sphere. As a conscious attitude of the artist, this work is not designed in a direct visual analogy with Koman’s works. During the animation, none of the moments of the transforming form look like Pi or 3D Moebius, however the subjective reading of Koman’s approach can be observed. 

With the integration of the sounds of various materials – which Koman used in his sculptures – Flux turns into an impressive spatial experience. Flux, also exemplifies that Koman’s work can be re-interpreted by the analysis and manipulation of form in the digital medium.",1.0

This same love of adventure and curiosity defines the brotherhood of Rick and Michael Mast. They share a fiercely independent spirit, leaping into the unknown and trusting that they’ll find the answer through endurance and dedication to their craft.
 
They began their voyage in their apartment, using a homemade machine to process cacao beans. Over time they cultivated their creation, sourcing beans from family farms in Madagascar, Venezuela, the Dominican Republic, and Ecuador. Each bar is handmade with incredible reverence for the process and history of chocolate. They are bound in ornamental papers and golden foil like a collection of rare books. Each bar offers its own story of flavors, and no two are exactly alike.
 
The Mast Brothers are now planning to navigate the mighty Atlantic, sailing to the Dominican Republic in search of beans and a deeper connection with the folks who grow them. Before they begin the next chapter, The Scout spent time with Rick and Michael documenting their story.

Chernobyl is one of the most interesting and dangerous places I've been. The nuclear disaster, which happened in 1986 (the year after I was born), had an effect on so many people, including my family when we lived in Italy.  The nuclear dust clouds swept westward towards us.  The Italian police went round and threw away all the local produce and my mother rushed out to purchase as much tinned milk as possible to feed me, her infant son.
 
It caused so much distress hundreds of miles away, so I can't imagine how terrifying it would have been for the hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian citizens who were forced to evacuate.
 
During my stay, I met so many amazing people, one of whom was my guide Yevgen, also known as a 'Stalker'. We spent the week together exploring Chernobyl and the nearby abandoned city of Pripyat. There was something serene, yet highly disturbing about this place. Time has stood still and there are memories of past happenings floating around us.

One of the challenges in making this video, was trying to get good storm with stars shots.  The opportunity doesn't come along very often, the storm has to be moving the right speed and the lightning can overexpose the long exposures.   I had several opportunities this summer to get storm and star shots.  In one instance, within a minute of picking up the camera and dolly, 70mph winds hit.  One storm was perfect, it came straight towards the setup, then died right before it reached it.

Extended cut available here http://dakotalapse.com/2011/08/tempest-milky-way/ 

At the 1:57 mark a Whitetail buck came in to check out the setup.  It was caught on 20 frames, and was there for about 10 minutes.  It was only 50 yards from the camera, dolly and light.  

At the 3:24 mark, a meteor reflects on the water of the small lake, see still below in Photos.  There are also quite a few other meteors in the timelapse.

This was all shot in central South Dakota from June-August.

Wanderers is a vision of humanity's expansion into the Solar System, based on scientific ideas and concepts of what our future in space might look like, if it ever happens. The locations depicted in the film are digital recreations of actual places in the Solar System, built from real photos and map data where available.
Without any apparent story, other than what you may fill in by yourself, the idea of the film is primarily to show a glimpse of the fantastic and beautiful nature that surrounds us on our neighboring worlds - and above all, how it might appear to us if we were there.

As some may notice I have borrowed ideas and concepts from science fiction authors such as Kim Stanley Robinson and Arthur C. Clarke, just to name a few. And visually, I of course owe many tips of my hat to painter Chesley Bonestell - the legendary master of space art.

More directly, with kind permission from Ann Druyan I have also borrowed the voice of astronomer and author Carl Sagan to narrate the film. The audio I used are excerpts from his own reading of his book 'Pale Blue Dot: A Vision of the Human Future in Space' (1994, Random House, http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/159735/pale-blue-dot-by-carl-sagan/) - needless to say, a huge inspiration for this film.

See the photography series: www.CarliDavidson.com

Shake off all the worries on your mind and smile! The dogs featured in SHAKE are simply here to offer you a couple minutes of wonder and laughter.  :)

SHAKE is based on a photography series of the same name by co-director Carli Davidson. The work was inspired by her own dog Norbert, whose drool she regularly cleans off walls due to his own frequent shaking. 

In 2012 the Variable team stumbled upon Carli Davidson's photo-series-gone-viral, "SHAKE", and immediately fell in love with the images of dogs that she was able to capture. The combination of innocence and ridiculousness had us all hysterically laughing, and of course thinking; "We NEED to meet this Carli and bring her images to life!" Fortunately for us, Carli responded to our enthusiastic e-mail with an even more enthusiastic e-mail stating that she was totally down to collaborate and had a very similar vision! After months and many meetings of trying to figure out how we could even afford to make this film, we all just decided to empty our pockets, pull some serious strings, and make the video purely for the fun of it. 

If you are fans of the video, there is a very good chance you will enjoy the book as well. Check it out on the link below and please consider supporting our awesome friend Carli. This is her first book, and we are certain it won't be her last!  

www.ShakeTheBook.com

*No dogs were harmed during the making of this film. We love animals. Please reach out to carlidavidson@gmail.com directly if you have any questions or concerns about the animal’s rolls and we will get back to you asap. Thanks in advance!

For most of the last 6 years I've been a traveling vagabond following my passion for rock climbing. This existence involved sleeping outside in wild places, hitching rides, having very little belongings, a drained bank account and some gourmet dumpster diving for food. I climbed everyday and lived my dream.

These days I'm a domesticated man. By most people's standards I'm still living in the ghetto with my 1988 beater car and trailer-like house. Each day I find time to escape to the nearby rock spires and bag a summit. Making this creative short I realized that I still live my dream everyday...!

We created and designed the live visual spectacle with a music video being produced from the results. We wanted it to be clear that the technology was real and actually being played live. The interface plays a key role in illustrating the idea of the instrument and we designed it to highlight the audio being controlled by the dancer. Design elements like real time tracking and samples being drawn on as they are played all add to authenticity of the performance. The visuals are all created live and the music video is essentially a real document of the night.

Two friends test the boundaries of free flight and friendship as they take their passion in a totally new direction. Join Tancrède and Julien on an incredible exploration into the world of free flight. The two friends are pioneers in ‘highlining’ - a vertiginous combination of climbing, slackline and tightrope walking. Using their skills and experience as climbers, the pair push their boundaries beyond the realms of possibility as they embark on a new evolution of their sport.

We travel from the Verdon gorge to the skyscrapers of Paris, and finally to the spectacular cliffs and fjords of Norway - where the pair plan to put weeks spent training to the ultimate test. Could months of planning and training really lead them to their dream of complete freedom... the freedom of flight?

The talented friends featured in my film have been instrumental in the innovation and development of highlining and baselining, and this exciting project was born from their passion and love for what they do.

I've crossed Cappadocia, Pamukkale, Ephesus, Istanbul, Konya; and tasted baklava, kunefe, doner, the turkish tea; and got the chance to meet the soul of Turkey, its people.. and got their smiles and their hospitality.

The documentary pays tribute to the spirit of street photography through a cinematic exploration of New York City, and captures the visceral rush, singular perseverance and at times immediate danger customary to these artists.  

Covering nine decades of street photography, “Everybody Street” explores the careers and influences of many notable photographers––a number of whom have never been documented, featuring: Bruce Davidson, Elliott Erwitt, Jill Freedman, Bruce Gilden, Joel Meyerowitz, Rebecca Lepkoff, Mary Ellen Mark, Jeff Mermelstein, Clayton Patterson, Ricky Powell, Jamel Shabazz, Martha Cooper, and Boogie, with historians Max Kozloff and Luc Sante.

To commemorate FITC Tokyo’s inaugural title sequence we sought to encapsulate the city itself—distilled to graphic form. Aiming to contrast the harmonies of traditional Japanese culture against the backdrop and sensory overload of present-day Tokyo, we meticulously crafted elegant typographic forms to collide with abrasive, overstimulating glitch—giving way to a progressive journey where moments of extreme chaos fold into temporary tranquility.

Knocked together from bits and pieces, decorated, ready for the junk heap or carefully maintained like antique cars, the vehicles are as charismatic as their owners, who brave the monstrous traffic of this metropolis daringly, sleepy, chattering or stoic, making sure the passanger's trip from A to B will be full of memorable experiences.

Based on days of riding around in rickshaws and drawings made locally, this animation captures the tough workaday life of a rickshaw driver, seen through the eyes of a European visitor.

Since the beginning of time people are fascinated by stories of hero’s. But did you know there is a fundamental structure that's lies beneath all these tales of fantasy. Joseph Campbell, a famous mythologist, was the first to discover similarities within all ancient myths. He called it the Monomyth. According to him there are 17 stages in which every hero has to walk through one way or the other. 

Christopher Vogler a Hollywood development executive was inspired by the writings of Campbell. He wrote his own adaptation guide for hollywood screenwriters.

In the hero’s journey his 12 stages are visualized by using iconic blockbuster movies that follow the same structure of storytelling.

Speed and accessibility have come at the expense of mystery, intimacy and tactility - qualities exclusive to analogue photography. Initially, and in reaction to this cultural atrophy, I composed a piece of music made entirely from sounds that I had recorded from a collection of antique cameras. Constructed using the digital composition software Reason, this piece carried a strong hip hop feel and seemed to connect past with future technologies. To accompany this track I created a video response that captured traditional, analogue techniques yet also had a strong contemporary theme.
 
This short film is made entirely with stop motion animation, with over six thousand still photos shot and then edited together. The cameras are literally ‘brought to life’ here, while image composition and lighting is as carefully considered in each video frame as they would be for individual photo shots.

With this project I wanted to explore the notion of the third dimension, with the desire to try to get out of the usual frame of a flat screen. For this, my work mainly consisted in exploring and experimenting a different device for displaying images, trying to give animations volume in space. The resulting machine works with the rotation of two screens placed back to back, creating a three-dimensional animated sequence that can be seen at 360 degrees. Due to the persistence of vision, the shapes that appear on the screen turn into kinetic light sculptures.",0.6695145

An unbelievable skier, one of the absolute all-time best - but skiing was just a sliver of his talents, and the gifts he gave our world.   His brilliantly creative mind understood the essence of progression, but it was his incredibly humble, kind, and humorous nature that brought it to reality.  Hard working, optimistic, and always caring - for the environment, for humanity, for friends and family.  This world needs more people like you my friend.

For 'The Lion City', the idea behind the extension of the tilt shift technique is for focus and distance to be something the viewer can experience. It also doubles to communicate the constant heat and humidity that hits you whenever you leave the comfort of air conditioning in Singapore.

"In a lot of ways, this is the antithesis of the modern ski porn flick. A lot of rock star skiers and not much skiing!  Ha! Well, hopefully having a narrative helps the piece along. It was a tough piece to put together with all the different characters. I decided to focus the story on Sage and Lucas and was hoping the piece would give people a sense of who those two characters are besides being rock star skiers/snowboarders. I often feel like the whole process of skiing and who the skiers actually are gets lost in most of the films today."  ~jimmy chin

The documentary pays tribute to the spirit of street photography through a cinematic exploration of New York City, and captures the visceral rush, singular perseverance and at times immediate danger customary to these artists.  

Covering nine decades of street photography, “Everybody Street” explores the careers and influences of many notable photographers––a number of whom have never been documented, featuring: Bruce Davidson, Elliott Erwitt, Jill Freedman, Bruce Gilden, Joel Meyerowitz, Rebecca Lepkoff, Mary Ellen Mark, Jeff Mermelstein, Clayton Patterson, Ricky Powell, Jamel Shabazz, Martha Cooper, and Boogie, with historians Max Kozloff and Luc Sante.

sebastien montaz-rosset,pro,13619,53,111,755,180,60,2482,1909,"I Believe I Can Fly (Flight of the Frenchies) is an amazing journey into the unknown. Two friends test the boundaries of free flight and friendship as they take their passion in a totally new direction. Join Tancrède and Julien on an incredible exploration into the world of free flight. The two friends are pioneers in ‘highlining’ - a vertiginous combination of climbing, slackline and tightrope walking. Using their skills and experience as climbers, the pair push their boundaries beyond the realms of possibility as they embark on a new evolution of their sport.

We travel from the Verdon gorge to the skyscrapers of Paris, and finally to the spectacular cliffs and fjords of Norway - where the pair plan to put weeks spent training to the ultimate test. Could months of planning and training really lead them to their dream of complete freedom... the freedom of flight?

The talented friends featured in my film have been instrumental in the innovation and development of highlining and baselining, and this exciting project was born from their passion and love for what they do.

It was filmed amongst a group of friends, with no funding or sponsorship for the training, filming & production involved.",0.9999996

Jonathan Yi,pro,2723,72,56,190,70,6,353,842216,"In early Fall 2011, I shot some footage with a pre-production model of the Canon EOS C300 for one week in NYC. I created an article and a video for Canon based on my experiences with the camera. The video is meant to poke fun at most camera test videos I've seen over the years. Canon, not thrilled with my sense of humor, does not credit or condone this video, but I think it shows a lot of the camera's strengths.

You can read my full article about the EOS C300 here: learn.usa.canon.com/resources/articles/2011/c300_for_cinematographers.shtml

I believe that Canon made a beautiful camera that is sensible, reliable and portable in a way that I've always dreamed a camera could be. It prioritizes great skin tone and has higher ISO sensitivity than any other camera out there.

I know there's nothing I can say to change the minds of the RED fan club. For the rest of the skeptics, I think once you get your hands on it you'll understand how great this camera really is. Please buy this camera in January and go film some good skin tones in the dark. You'll love it.

Thanks go out to all my friends for helping me with this.

Commissioned by our client, A/G NYM, we were charged with the task to create a short film based around theme "Finish(ed)" - the idea of overcoming the immediate while pressing on in the greater journey.

It was filmed on site for 10 days in Colorado with Andy Catarisano leading the shoot and Jon Prensner feeling the cold burn of antiquated hiking gear.  This project was conceptualized around a year ago, and the cast/crew did an exceptional job in bearing both sub-zero temperatures as well as the burden of time that a project can take.  After an initial delivery 3 months into the project, the team charged through and pulled off sets of revisions to bring this piece to the place it deserved to be, so massive thanks to everyone.

Therefore we will not fear, though the earth give way and the mountains fall into the heart of the sea, though its waters roar and foam and the mountains quake with their surging. Psalm 46:2-3

The principle runs through all life from top to bottom.  Give up yourself, and you will find your real self.  Lose your life and you will save it.  Submit to death, death of your ambitions and favourite wishes every day and death of your whole body in the end: submit with every fibre of your being, and you will find eternal life.  Keep back nothing.  Nothing that you have not given away will be really yours.  Nothing in you that has not died will ever be raised from the dead.  Look for yourself, and you will find in the long run only hatred, loneliness, despair, rage, ruin, and decay.  But look for Christ and you will find Him and with Him everything else thrown in.

People had gathered up there this night to get the best view possible of the moon rising. I captured the video from 2.1km away on the other side of the city. It's something that I've been wanting to photograph for a long time now, and a lot of planning and failed attempts had taken place. Finally, during moon rise on the 28th January 2013, everything fell into place and I got my footage.

The video is as it came off the memory card and there has been no manipulation whatsoever. Technically it was quite a challenge to get the final result. I shot it on a Canon ID MkIV in video mode with a Canon EF 500mm f/4L and a Canon 2x extender II, giving me the equivalent focal length of 1300mm.

Cheetahs are the fastest runners on the planet. Combining the resources of National Geographic Magazine and the Cincinnati Zoo, and drawing on the skills of an incredible crew, we documented these amazing cats in a way that’s never been done before.

Using a Phantom camera filming at 1200 frames per second while zooming beside a sprinting cheetah, the team captured every nuance of the cat’s movement as it reached top speeds of 60+ miles per hour.

The extraordinary footage that follows is a compilation of multiple runs by five cheetahs during three days of filming.

I have always been fascinated by color as a form of non-verbal communication.  Color has a profound and powerful psychological effect on us and it makes the perfect tool for providing subtext in film—as well as supporting a certain theme or providing the right mood.

Kubrick has always used red to great effect—not only for atmosphere but for the fact that the various meanings ascribed to red echo many of the themes in his films.

Red’s many meanings include: death, blood, danger, anger, energy, war, strength, power, determination…but also passion, desire, love, and sex.  All prominent themes in Kubrick’s work.  But more importantly the very dualistic nature of red (the fact that it can mean anger but also love) plays right into the grand “Jungian" theme in all of Kubrick’s work which is this notion of Duality: sex and violence, birth and death, war and peace, fear and desire...

In the end my motivation to make this piece was simply to contribute to the growing collection of deconstruction surrounding Kubrick's work found on the web and to inspire people to revisit or discover his catalog of films and to think more critically about color in film.

Film by Patrick Mccue & Tobias Wiesner

The movie is based on the short story “GOLEM XIV” of “Imaginary Magnitude” by Stanislaw Lem from 1973.
The book is written from the perspective of a military A.I. computer who obtains consciousness, moving towards personal technological singularity with growing intelligence.
It starts to refuse military support because it detects a basic lacking of internal logical consistency of war.
GOLEM gives several lectures with focus on mankind's position in the process of evolution and the possible biological and intellectual future of humanity before it ceases communication.

The movie tells about the first point of its "about man threefold" lecture as a reduced and simplified version while visually weaving this  with GOLEM simulating human culture processes based on ideas and dynamics of freedom and curiosity, fear and security, abstraction and fiction, the lack of accessibility in face of unknowing and the need for generating meaning.

The whole creative intention about this project is to face your own process in this world with reflection and self responsibility, to stay curious and create, look for new ideas and stay keen.

Consuming Spirits is a hand-made independent feature animation shot frame-by-frame on 16mm using paper cut outs, models, and tracing paper cell animation.

It chronicles the lives of three characters who live in a rust belt town called Magguson, and work at its local newspaper The Daily Suggester. They are: Gentian Violet 42: Victor Blue 38: and Earl gray 64, who first appear to be acquaintances. But as the film unfolds, we find they have a long diabolical history, revolving around social service intervention, foster care, romance and hatred. Each character has family secrets to hide, and family secrets to discover. An auto accident one dark and inebriated night causes a crack in the memory vault of these intimate strangers. By films end all parties walk from the woods, both healed and wounded.

Written/Directed/Edited by Chris Sullivan, 16mm to HD, 131 minutes.

"Critic's Pick.  Entirely original. . .an inquiry into the darkest zones of the human heart. . .Weaves a complicated, intoxicating spell…a wonder." - A.O. Scott, New York Times

"****[Four Stars!] A monstrous visual achievement… one of the most uniquely humanistic animated features of all time." -Joseph Jon Lanthier, Slant

"Recommended! An emotionally raw, thoroughly original film, a labor of painstaking love 15 years in the making….a haunted reverie…constructed of ugliness shot through with moments of unexpected beauty" -- Ian Buckwalter, NPR

. It took Sullivan more than a decade to make (stop motion and cutouts take time), so let it all go down like an 18-year Macallan. It’s like: Todd Solonz went to town with scissors!

Chaque Chacun des personnages va découvrir des secrets de famille qui étaient enfouis. Un accident d'auto par une nuit sombre et inébriée fait une fissure dans la caisse des souvenances pour ces étrangers intimes. À la fin du film, tout le monde sort de la forêt, à la fois guéri et blessé.......amusez-vous.

The film brings to life Randi’s intricate investigations that publicly exposed psychics, faith healers, and con-artists with quasi-religious fervor. A master deceiver who came out of the closet at the age of 81, Randi created fictional characters, fake psychics, and even turned his partner of 25 years, the artist Jose Alvarez, into a sham guru named Carlos. But when a shocking revelation in Randi’s personal life is discovered, it isn’t clear whether Randi is still the deceiver – or the deceived.

Written by Drake Martinet http://www.withdrake.com
Illustration and Animation by Emanuele Colombo http://www.emanuelecolombo.it
Music: Monday - Jon Brion

In May 2012 I was browsing the Web in search of inspiration for a personal project, and I found this amazing declaration of love in form of an info-graphic written by Drake Martinet. I asked his permission to create an animated version, he liked the idea and this is what came out of our collaboration.

The project was an unexpected viral success; it has been viewed more than one million times.",0.9992483
Erica Kobren,basic,241,32,52,165,9,1,130,136924,"Well, here it is, my finished thesis! 

At SVA, everyone graduating has to complete a thesis. As Computer Art majors, we started the process at the beginning of our junior year. 

From the beginning, I knew I wanted to have my thesis about dreams and lucid dreaming. (The subject has always fascinated me. My AP Art portfolio in high school was also about dreams!) Coming up with a story, however, was hard. I wanted to make it about my own dreams, so it started out as someone just traveling through all these random dreams. After coming up with concept art and storyboarding it all out, I realized that it was just too long and confusing. 

So, I picked out one of my favorite dreams, where I'm flying, and transform into a hawk. It needed some sort of storyline, so I incorporated another dream where I "wake up" and fly out my bedroom window. 

The rest of junior year was spent tweaking storyboards and making production schedules. At this point, I knew that I wanted to use the Waking Life rotoscope technique. Every second, every frame, would be that much more work. The deadline of April 2009 was always looming.

The summer of 2008 was spent filming. Starting out, I was using a Sony HDR-HC7. Great camera, until there was a problem with the tape drive! (Luckily it was under warranty, so it got sent off to be repaired.) However, I still had most of my filming to do, so I was able to get ahold of a Sony HDR-HC9... even better! I used an Ewa-Marine underwater housing (Really, it just looked like a big ziplock bag! But it kept my camera dry, and that's all that matters!) for all the "flying" sequences. 

Senior year, Fall 2008. Thesis work really begins. I worked with my thesis advisor to really tighten my cut, trimming out any unnecessary frames. Then, every frame was hand drawn in Photoshop. This part took the longest, about five months. Then color was added in After Effects. Aaaand... here it is!  

The title comes from reading the book "Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming" by Stephen LaBerge. In it, he uses the word oneironaut to mean "explorer of the dream world." I scanned in that page, and you can see it in the background in the very beginning, if you look closely!

The music used is "Escape into the Twilight" by Skrypnyk. You can download it for free from Overclocked Remix!

Bruce W. Berry Jr,plus,1688,28,83,260,20,23,248,1710637,"All Time-lapse sequences were taken by the astronauts onboard the International Space Station (ISS) (Thanks guys for making this available to the public for use!)  All footage has been color graded, denoised, deflickered, slowed down and stabilized by myself.  Clips were then complied and converted to 1080 HD at 24 frames/sec.

Some interesting tidbits about the ISS.  It orbits the planet about once every 90 mins and is about 350 Km/217 miles. The yellow/greenish line that you see over the earth is Airglow.  

Hope you all enjoy it and thanks for watching!

P.S.  It would be a dream to actually be up there in the ISS.  Btw NASA, if you need a Biochemistry Ph.D to do some work for you up there, I’m your man, LOL!

Together with Blacklist and a crew of otherworldly talents from around the world, we created the teaser, launch film, and global Nike in-store installations. We built an A-list team for the project that included one of our award-winning HIGH5ER studios, Frame, to co-direct. What was totally unique about the project for us was the global collaboration. Blacklist is in NY, Tendril in Toronto, Frame in Denmark, Nike in Portland, and there was a slew of freelance gurus dotted all over the world. In total we had Canada, US, Brazil, Germany, Slovenia, Denmark and the UK all on this project. This made it an explosion of deadly talents. We all worked together hooked up by a massive 2TB Dropbox account.

Besides the amazing team who we had the pleasure of collaborating with, shout-outs to Google Hangouts, Sheets, Slack, Dropbox, continental airline travel, coffee, and beer for helping make this other-worldly experience a pain-free collaboration.

Jonathan Yi,pro,2723,72,56,190,70,6,353,842216,"In early Fall 2011, I shot some footage with a pre-production model of the Canon EOS C300 for one week in NYC. I created an article and a video for Canon based on my experiences with the camera. The video is meant to poke fun at most camera test videos I've seen over the years. Canon, not thrilled with my sense of humor, does not credit or condone this video, but I think it shows a lot of the camera's strengths.

You can read my full article about the EOS C300 here: learn.usa.canon.com/resources/articles/2011/c300_for_cinematographers.shtml

I believe that Canon made a beautiful camera that is sensible, reliable and portable in a way that I've always dreamed a camera could be. It prioritizes great skin tone and has higher ISO sensitivity than any other camera out there.

I know there's nothing I can say to change the minds of the RED fan club. For the rest of the skeptics, I think once you get your hands on it you'll understand how great this camera really is. Please buy this camera in January and go film some good skin tones in the dark. You'll love it.

Thanks go out to all my friends for helping me with this.

Philip Bloom,pro,70473,202,695,10825,322,113,258,60484,"Filmed in the Arizona Desert outside Phoenix and in the Nevada desert around Las Vegas. 

I have taken my time before posting footage. I first flew a Phantom at the beginning of Feb but haven't had much opportunity to practise my flying skills as I live in London under the Heathrow flight path! 

There is a lot to learn and as you can see in this edit the best shots, well I think so, are the really controlled slow shots where I held my composition around the cacti. I still am nowhere near good yet. I need the controls to be second nature. The effective reversing of them when facing different ways stills screws with my head the same way switching between Canon and Nikon glass does with it's opposing focus direction!

A full review of this and my Phantom 2 with Zenmuse 2 axis gimbal for the GoPro is coming very soon in the meantime this is an edit together of footage shot using the just released DJI Phantom Vision 2+. There is no GoPro footage in this edit. My blog post will also cover in depth the safety aspects as well as the legal stuff you must know! 

The video review will go much more in depth, compare images etc.... but here are a few words to tie in with this edit to tide you over for now:

The 3 axis gimbal of the new Vision 2+ is excellent. It works beautifully and I assume will perform in a very similar way to the the new 3 axis ZenMuse gimbal for the GoPro Hero 3. 

The camera is the same camera as the standard Vision 2 which doesn't have the gimbal. It's OK. The stills are very good. The video isn't so good, especially when you compare it to the GoPro 3. In fact the GoPro Hero 3+ 2.7K mode is so bloody good that it makes it a shame to shoot with anything else. 

That being said the integrated system that the Vision 2 and Vision 2+ uses is fantastic and the best way to learn.Having a very good quality "first person view" of what the camera sees on your iphone or android PLUS all the telemetry info which you need makes the system a dream to use. Learning to fly without FPV Is tough as is getting your composition right.

The wifi range or the system too is also excellent thanks to the strong repeater built into the controller. In fact it's much better than my current FPV system which I have on my Phantom 2 for my GoPro. That system has many different components from different components that works over an analogue transmitting and receiving system. It's temperamental and far from neat! The Vision 2 set up is SO neat. 

The 3 axis gimbal does wonders but is fragile. The Phantom 2 is pretty robust. I have crashed a fair few times in my learning curve of flying. I have never done this before, never flied RC helicopters or anything similar. It takes practice, lots of it. The Phantom itself seems to take a fair few crashes with ease. The gimbal though is quite fragile and an impact can cause it to malfunction. In fact if you are learning I would almost recommend the non plus Vision 2 Phantom. You won't get smooth video but the stills are great and it's very robust compared to the gimbal. That is what i bought first to learn with. Made total sense now and I still recommend it even though you will be itching to Upgrade to a gimbal quite quickly. Learn to walk first! :)

I shot this in the 1080P 25p. It shoots up to 30p in 1080p. 60p is available in 720p. Avoid the in camera sharpening. I shot this in the "soft" setting. It is that indeed. Really quite soft. I have had to do a lot of work on the footage to try to bring it to life. I still haven't quite succeeded. The standard and high setting are very harsh and unnatural video like. Avoid them! I have done so much sharpening on this footage. Some works better than others. 

Warp stabilise in Premiere was used on just 3 shots due to high wind. Most of the time it simply wasn't needed. The 3 axis gimbal does wonders. Wind is bloody scary. Even with GPS mode on (which I turn off for intricate moves to avoid the corrections it keeps doing) it can move away from you quite fast if the wind catches it plus also be very careful of battery life. If it gets too low it won't be able to climb and that can be a problem! Bring it back at 30% to be extra cautious. Battery life is around 25 minutes. 

I ran this through after effects to remove most of the barrel distortion.

The bit rate of the the recorded MP4 is also a huge problem. It's around 12 MB/s in the 1080p mode. That's half of AVCHD way short of the GoPro Hero 3+ in 2.7K mode which is around 43 MB/s.

If DJI could put a better camera in, it doesn't have to be as high quality as the top end mode of the Hero 3+ (although that would be nice!), something that could give me a highly detailed 1080p image with a higher bitrate then I would be much happier.

We created and designed the live visual spectacle with a music video being produced from the results. We wanted it to be clear that the technology was real and actually being played live. The interface plays a key role in illustrating the idea of the instrument and we designed it to highlight the audio being controlled by the dancer. Design elements like real time tracking and samples being drawn on as they are played all add to authenticity of the performance. The visuals are all created live and the music video is essentially a real document of the night.

In Alberta, on the plains north of Calgary, the winters are long and cold they bite with big white teeth.  These rural, simple and hardworking people sit patiently by their fires and wait for summer, a summer that is always short and hot. 

When I was 6, I would jump into the backseat of my dad's pickup truck as he would drive my brother, Jamie, all over the country to his baseball games.  I loved baseball.  I loved baseball almost as much as them.  I would stand beside my friend Ryan and we would watch the game and watch our brothers and look through the chain link fence with our young keen eyes.  We saw the balls, the strikes, the out's and the coach's walk to mound; but what we waited for was the foul balls. 

If a foul ball flew over the fence, Ryan and I would sprint like outfielders to track it down in a race that was always even because we both got our fair share of foul balls as far as I can remember.  With the ball in one of our gloves, we would saunter over to a little white shack that always needed a paint job and the old Mrs. Claus looking lady at the concession stand would hold out her big soft hand and we place the ball into it like we were at a carnival.  With her other hand she handed us a quarter.  We would hand it straight back to her for 2 licorice's and chew them all the way back to the chain link fence.  I loved baseball.

My dad also loved baseball. He would be the guy that sat on the bleachers holding one of those baseball scorebooks, the one with the coils all down one side and with a thousand little baseball diamond pictures inside where he would translate the game into this picture language. He must be really good at remember pictures because he would keep the score in this book game after game, and there were lots of them, and now at 67 years old he still remembers all these plays in the baseball game.  My brother hit a triple down the right field line to drive in 3 with the bases loaded in Oyen to win a Provincial game. Another time, with runners on first and second Jamie caught a line drive, stepped on second and overthrew the neighbor kid (Shawn Gorr) at first only to cover the bag and get all 3 outs by himself. 

My dad remembers this.

I wrote a song called The Closer. It's a story about a pitcher in a small town, a lot like the one I grew up in, who is pitching a perfect game into the 9th inning.  But his mom runs onto the mound and tells him that he needs to leave the game because his dad has had a farming accident. So the coach brings in the closer with a 2-0 lead in the 9th inning.  He gives up a walk.  Then a single.  Then a home-run.  They lose the game 3-2 in the 9th. 

I think that sometimes we think that these small moments in small towns don't matter, but the truth is that they do. 

The baseball diamonds, and the hockey rinks and the community centers are the theaters where life takes place for these people.  They are the stages that hold the metaphors for the joys and the tragedy's of simple life.  Everybody comes in the heat of a short summer and sits there, cheering and groaning and feeling joy and heartbreak together.  And they all love baseball.

I'll start by showing you how to use C4D's Spline Wrap to create our ribbon along with some handy tips to sell that 2D illustrative look.  Then, to get the flat 2D color, we'll use materials created by the Cel Shader & Spline Shader.   Finally, I'll show you some creative ways to animate the ribbon to give it some nice organic movement.   You'll even learn some Latin!  This tutorial has it all, huh?  Again when working with Cinema 4D to create 2D vector looking art, be sure when you render to turn up the Anti-Aliasing settings as well as using a sharper Filter than Animation; such as Cubic (Still Image) or Sync so you have nice crisp edges in your animation to sell the 2D style.

Conceived together with my friend Vitor Cervi, and based on the event’s predefined visual id and colour palette, we created a series of delirious and nonsensical loops where fragmented ideas and images emerge, collapse and resonate, affecting and being embraced by the character. We tried to convey the feeling of personal hecatomb and collective impregnation that only the creative process can bring up.

This year we where tasked with creating the opening title sequence, title slates and idents for the prestigious D&AD awards.    I provided the concept, design and art direction with additional help from Oliver Harris . These where then brought to life by Oliver and Matt Whitewood. A lot of hard work all round especially within such a short timeframe.  Each machine was designed to utilise objects and materials that you would find in an art and design shop. This was to reflect the qualities of D&AD.

"Colorimetry" is a book at the crossroads between graphic design and visual arts. It's a catalog of shapes generated using the database of colorimetry and simple rules. You can buy the book on the website of the publisher, "La chose imprimée": http://lachoseimprimee.com/les-publications/colorimetrie-le-livre/

"Colorimetry in motion" shows translations between those amalgams of shapes. Éric-Renaud Houde designed an app capable of animating the shapes and modify some of their parameters. By recording the generated animations, it was possible to produce a choreography that accompanies the book. The film was designed to loop in a gallery space. You can find the code for the app here: https://github.com/colorimetrie/colorimetrie

«Colorimétrie» est un livre à la croisée entre design graphique et arts visuels. En partant des systèmes colorimétriques, les données sont détournées de leurs fonctions pour traduire formellement les couleurs grâce à des règles simples. En sélectionnant aléatoirement plusieurs couleurs, ces règles génèrent des amalgames de formes superposés. Vous pouvez vous procurer le livre sur le site de «La chose imprimée»: http://lachoseimprimee.com/les-publications/colorimetrie-le-livre/

«Colorimétrie en mouvement» effectue des translations entre les amalgames de formes superposées. Éric-Renaud Houde a conçu une application qui permet d'animer les formes et de modifier certains de leurs paramètres. En enregistrant les animations générées, il a été possible de produire une chorégraphie qui accompagne le livre. Le film est conçu pour jouer en boucle dans une galerie.

Here is my latest video featuring Ryan Nangle, a talented UK Dirt Jumper. I've been living in UK for around 6.5 years and throughout this period I've never got a chance to film anyone until January 2011. I talked to Ryan Nangle on Facebook, who turned out to be a friendly rider and we went down to film with Blake and Ray Samson, Adam Williams, Danny Pace and Marcel Hunt. 

After that filming session, I've talked with Ryan about making a new type of project, which is something a bit more than your usual riding edits and he was interested in taking part. I wanted to show the riders themselves as to who they are and what they do in their daily lives. I went to Ryan's home town, we drove down to get his new forks and then to the jumps for filming some riding.

After the shoot I sent Ryan a few questions to answer about himself and he was up for it. Thanks for that ;)

Thank you:

Pacific Pictures,pro,5587,23,0,1941,29,20,1722,None,"What happens to a dream when it becomes reality? Does it still exist somewhere, in some ethereal place, waiting to come to fruition again? Could a fictional narrative capture the true meaning behind a real, live event with more drama and emotion than a traditional documentary? These were some of the questions that arose when we took on the “City of Lakes” project, an unprecedented attempt to combine a fully scripted narrative with Melissa & Samir's real, live wedding. The live wedding and production would be shot simultaneously on-location in Udaipur, India over nine days. Upon completion, "City of Lakes" would become the first wedding concept film ever to be produced on this scale. 

“City of Lakes” is as much a story about what it means to return to one's homeland as it is an exploration of Vedic tradition and the rituals of a Hindu marriage. Melissa & Samir had always dreamed of being married in India. We hope this film helps them cherish that dream in ways beyond traditional videography. We're thankful for the acting talents and professionalism of Anubhab Saha, Sharon Chawda and Rushad Rana, and the amazing support of sponsors Canon USA, Tiffen-Steadicam, and Cinevate. There is a final question we hope you’ll find difficult to answer as you watch this film: "what is real?"

-----------------

If you asked the average person, many would characterize this summer's monsoon as a down season. Not a lot of storms overall and it seemed generally more quiet. And in many ways it actually was a slower season. All told I chased about 36 days for this film, which was less than the 48 in 2015. We had an early start in late June, and then it was dead for almost three weeks. When I looked back and realized I chased 12 less days...yeah, it definitely had less action than normal.

But to a storm chaser, none of this really means anything. Sure there were days when nothing was remotely possible to chase, but most of the time the monsoon can be found in the far corners of the state even when Phoenix and Tucson are dry as a bone.

For me personally, I loved this season. Maybe because as a filmmaker, having put out a few of these films now, I'm beginning to focus and hone in more on what I really love to time-lapse. My early scenes years ago had a lot of average clouds and distant rain that didn't have a lot of excitement or energy. But as the years go on, and I learn more and more about chasing storms here in Arizona...I've found myself in better spots to capture the stuff I really enjoy. Strong downbursts of rain, building clouds, lightning...and yes, dust storms.

The one thing I was hoping for in 2016 that the previous years have lacked: Haboobs. Dust storms. Rolling walls of dirt and sand engulfing the deserts and even Phoenix itself. And my wish came true in that regard. Even a very late season, September 27th haboob that I captured right at sunset with glorious colors.

Coming off the heels of filming Vorticity in the spring, with monster supercells and tornadoes, the monsoon is a totally different beast and you'd think it would be less exciting. I don't know. I find them both amazing and inspiring. Weather to me is weather. No matter how mind-blowing it was to witness the Wynnewood tornado this past spring, standing in front of a rolling wall of dust, or a distant lightning storm under the stars...it's all a blast to me and I never get tired of it. 

So Monsoon III...the credits will say it, but it was around 36 days of filming, I shot over 85,000 frames and am not sure how much made it into the final cut. The song I used was "Revenge" and "Revenge: Epilogue" by Kerry Muzzey, and I took both of them and sliced and diced until I actually had a six-minute version to fit in with all the footage I captured. I love it. 

As always...THANK YOU to Kerry Muzzey for supporting my work by letting me use his music once again. I don't even have enough words for this man for doing this for me. It means more than anything! Please buy his work!

I started editing this film mid-summer once I figured out the song I was using. And as days went by and more clips were rendered, I kept adding them and re-arranging them all the time, trying to get every clip to match the tone and feeling of the music. And then I'd think I was done and more storms would come and I'd have to move things around again, and even drop stuff. I have a lot of fun scenes that are not in this film because I only wanted the very best.

Special thanks to Bryan Snider and Dustin Farrell for some tips this summer on editing out dust spots and birds better than I had been doing. Appreciate it fellas!

My wife takes the brunt of what I do, especially when I'm gone for days at a time. Filming in Arizona is easier because I'm usually home at some point in the evening and at least around in the mornings. But it's a lot of work and a lot of time being away. She supports me like no other and I can't believe how lucky I am to have someone with that much faith in what I do.

And a lot of these clips will forever hold memories for me because my two oldest kiddos were there for them, and at times even all three were nearby. My littlest guy who just turned three, sits on my lap a lot when I edit, listens to the music and loves watching the final product. And he wants to keep watching it...over, and over and over. 

Makes a daddy proud.

I hope you enjoy this latest installment. I'm not sure how it compares to years past, but for better or worse, this was Monsoon 2016 for me!

Please let me know if you have any questions about anything! Most of these clips were shot in 8K with some 4K stuff thrown in there as well.

'Eva' is a retrofuturistic sci-fi thriller in which Alex, a young scientist, returns to the town where he grew up to complete an unfinished project and create a boy robot.

A project that began as a job turned nearly into a personal project due to the creative freedom and the confidence that the director gave us. We were very inspired by the whole aesthetical universe of the film: the snow, the vintage laboratories, the old machinery... and we tried to put all this together in the titles so that they would slowly introduce the viewers to the world of 'Eva'.

Since the beginning of time people are fascinated by stories of hero’s. But did you know there is a fundamental structure that's lies beneath all these tales of fantasy. Joseph Campbell, a famous mythologist, was the first to discover similarities within all ancient myths. He called it the Monomyth. According to him there are 17 stages in which every hero has to walk through one way or the other. 

Christopher Vogler a Hollywood development executive was inspired by the writings of Campbell. He wrote his own adaptation guide for hollywood screenwriters.

In the hero’s journey his 12 stages are visualized by using iconic blockbuster movies that follow the same structure of storytelling.

Leica Camera,pro,12445,587,2,367,282,0,217,None,"A Cleveland, Ohio native, Jonathan Mannion began capturing images of up-and-coming urban music superstars after working for a year with world-renowned photographer Richard Avedon. In 1996, he launched his professional career by shooting the photographs for the classic hip-hop album “Reasonable Doubt” by Jay-Z. In the years since, Jonathan’s photography has grown alongside the culture he so loves, helping to visually define an era of urban music. As DJ Quik once pointed out to him, the world sees hip-hop through his eyes. However, he is modestly circumspect about his role. “I’m just a messenger," he observes, "and I’ve been given a talent to document an extremely important era of music history. I have a love for hip-hop that goes back to when I was a teenager, and I feel blessed to have had the chance to shoot the artists I’ve worked with. I’ve had the opportunity to grow with them and the photos I’ve shot over the years have become visual bullet points of their creative evolution and mine."

It's something that I've been wanting to photograph for a long time now, and a lot of planning and failed attempts had taken place. Finally, during moon rise on the 28th January 2013, everything fell into place and I got my footage.

The video is as it came off the memory card and there has been no manipulation whatsoever. Technically it was quite a challenge to get the final result. I shot it on a Canon ID MkIV in video mode with a Canon EF 500mm f/4L and a Canon 2x extender II, giving me the equivalent focal length of 1300mm.

If 3 million YouTube views of last year’s debut “aNYway” are any indicator, the official release of “Barbra Streisand” will be met with rabid anticipation as fan-recorded bootlegs have fueled blog excitement all summer. 

"Barbra Streisand" continues to perfect the Duck Sauce sound, which joyously mashes classic disco house with forward-thinking dancefloor energy and expert production. A-Trak and AVH are bona fide DJ heroes whose team-ups are fueled by anything-goes samples, an almost childlike sense of fun, and 100% NYC attitude. This approach has made Duck Sauce fans-for-life out of partygoers around the globe, and will continue to convert anyone within earshot of "Barbra"'s instantly addictive, whistling hook. 

For the video, director So Me (Justice, Kid Cudi, MGMT) uses the song to soundtrack a hyperactive, ecstatic New York City travelogue. Shot over a week of long nights out with A-Trak and Armand (including live footage from the Fool's Gold "Day Off" labor day block party), the clip is a pop-art adventure starring commandeered taxis and hotdog stands, sexy strangers, and a who's-who of famous friends: rappers, producers, indie rockers, graffiti writers and nightlife icons all take turns adding their own special sauce to the song, turning "Barbra Streisand" into one of this year's must-rewind clips.

In the above video, Jon Carr, gives a more practical breakdown of how these features were used on our latest film, "Mobius" – http://vimeo.com/31525127 notably in terms of rotoscoping.  During a particular scene in the film our protagonist (David Lyons) is taking pictures of a Cartel execution from an outcropping of rocks.  Unfortunately, the rocks that we used on location were covered with graffiti (the location is usually a well trafficked off-roading recreation area).  

However, in the film, this location needed to sell as the middle of nowhere, not to mention Mexico – so the graffiti had to go.  The above video walks you through the workflow of this: linking the footage out of Premiere and into After Effects, from there exporting a still from the footage into Photoshop, and then using the photoshopped version of that still in After Effects with the rotoscoping and tracking tools.  The end effect is unnoticeable – but that’s the goal – as it sells the scene as being in a remote location.  This workflow will work for you no matter what effects you are trying to achieve, and shows just how seamless the Adobe workflow is across the multiple application in their Production Premium suite.",0.9974324

Dan Andrew,plus,368,122,1317,42,178,9,30,7029,"For this project we worked directly with MBNA to produce and create this TVC spot. We came up with the concept and creative, and then worked alongside a copywriter to produce the script which we then pitched to the client.
 
Once we had won the job the director proceeded to work very closely with one of The Studio 3D operators to develop and direct the idea into a moving animation. This proved to be technically challenging due to the sheer amount of cards that needed to be animated and triggered by each other in order to build our world of credit cards. Everything had to be scripted carefully to work together not to mention how big our scene became as we added and animated more and more structures. In the end more than 10,000 cards were created,  each and everyone had an expression tagged to it to allow bespoke animation or to be triggered by other instances.

Cinema 4d and its Mograph module was the obvious choice. We tried to keep everything very light: we used Instances under a Cloner to lay the main credit card grid, made it editable (so we could change these "main" instances in other credit cards or buildings made of credit cards) and then select some of these instances and animated them with a Fracture object and Plain or Shader effector.
To create the buildings, we used a Cloner and the instance of the credit card model (we really struggled to keep the project manageable), a Shader and a Color shader on the texture to keep the side of the cards white but not the top of the building. A light Random effector helped us giving a little bit of realness on the stack of cards.
The Fracture object usually moves the pivot point to the center of the object, but not with the Instances. So, using Instances were the best choice for our projects: we had total control on the cards and on their axis center.
Even each card is an Extrude object of just one instanced rectangle spline: in this way we could change the spline points at once.
The project was composited in Nuke then refined in Smoke before being graded using Resolve. The work flow worked brilliantly from C4D to Nuke as camera data could be shared as well as inital Nuke scripts outputed straight from C4D. 
On this project we decided to render seperate passes rather than EXR. files due to the timings however we have used both methods with complete success.
 
The entire production took a little over 4 weeks to finish, with a synchronized print campaign to follow up the TVC led by our creative upon launch.
 
My involvement in this project was as Director/designer and compositor.

SYNOPSIS:
Mountains in Motion: The Canadian Rockies is an award-winning short film documenting the life of the alpine landscape through time-lapse photography. In an effort to highlight the wildness of these mountain places and how they have inspired explorers of the past, present and future, time-lapse sequences were patiently gathered from exposed summits, by glacial lakes, and under aurora-filled skies.

Hours and even months of change lapses in a matter of seconds, providing the viewer with a rare insight into the ever-changing nature of the landscape. Weaving throughout the film are reflections of an early mountaineer, who is deeply moved by his own encounter with the mountains and the revelations of explorers who have come before him. “What is this power that lures me upwards, into the unknown,” he wonders, “that pulls me deeper, despite snow, wind and exhaustion?”

Made on a shoestring budget and with entirely volunteer hours, the film brought together artists from two vastly different parts of North America - Banff, Alberta, and Atlanta, Georgia. Strangers at the start, the film team developed strong friendships over the course of production and were united by their common goal of capturing the beauty and essence of a place that inspires them every day. 

This 100% human-powered film combines advanced time-lapse photography with an original story and musical score to bring the landscape center-stage and offers a thrilling new perspective that re-establishes the Canadian Rockies among the finest mountains in the world.

The team was approx 4/5 people, working over a couple of months.

Made in 3dsmax, rendered in vray, post in AfterFX.

It's a bit flickery in places, but we were on a tight deadline before we had to get back to paid work. Only just managed to fit it in.

Might see about re-rendering a few bits.

The body is Mo-Cap, the Face is hand animated morph targets. 

The Mo-Cap was recorded at Audiomotion (www.audiomotion.com)

The Mo-Cap data is taken from one continuous stream. The whole piece plays end to end, so we could concentrate on the cinematography.

Characters were modelled in zbrush.

Prime Burger Restaurant, in Midtown Manhattan
For many of the guys that work here, the restaurant is like a second home - some of them have been slinging burgers, making shakes, and waiting on customers at this location for decades.  Opened in 1938, the place hasn't been altered since the early '60s, and it looks all the better for it.

Here the waiters and workers of Prime Burger discuss their views on their chosen profession, and the unique nature of the place itself.

THIS MUST BE THE PLACE

There's no place like home. It's where we live, work and dream. It's our sanctuary and our refuge. We can love them or hate them. It can be just for the night or for the rest of our lives. But whoever we may be, we all have a place we call home.

THIS MUST BE THE PLACE is a series of short films that explore the idea of home, or places that function as home - workplaces, hang out spots, etc.  We want to figure out what makes them, how they represent us, why we need them. 

We're always on the lookout for dwellings of all sorts. If you've come across any curious or eccentric homes or other curious places, feel free to send them along.
